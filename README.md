This is a simple SwiftUI app that simulates a traffic light. The app displays three stacked views representing the three colors of a traffic light: red, yellow, and green. The colors change sequentially when the "Next" button is tapped.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on the iOS Simulator or a physical device running iOS.

## Usage

When the app is launched, the initial state of the traffic light is red. The color changes to yellow, then green, and finally back to red in a continuous loop when the "Next" button is tapped.
